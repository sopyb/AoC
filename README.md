# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges,
showcasing a variety of programming languages each year.

Languages I chose are languages I want to learn or languages I want to get more
comfortable with.

## Structure

- Each year is organized into its own directory (e.g., `2023`) containing
  subdirectories for each day (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`, ...).
- Inside each day's directory, you'll find the source code written in the
  specified language and any necessary input files.
- Each year's directory also contains a `README.md` file with a brief
  description of the language used and any other relevant information.

## Usage

Feel free to explore these solutions as a reference to your own learning. 
I learned a lot from reading other people's code when I was first starting out.
Maybe you will too!
